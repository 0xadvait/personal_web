# My Mac-Style Personal Website

This is a **Next.js** project that recreates key elements of the **macOS** experience right in the browser. It was originally inspired by the [Dragonfly](https://www.dragonfly.xyz/) design aesthetic, but expanded to include Mac-like touches such as a draggable desktop **Dock**, movable/resizable **windows**, and a **Terminal** emulator that processes custom commands. The site features a **dark** motif with subtle highlights, plus an ASCII background effect for added flair.

## Features

- **macOS-Like Window System:** Draggable, resizable windows with a title bar and traffic‐light style close/minimize/maximize buttons.
- **Interactive Terminal:** Type commands to display “print(intro),” “print(resume),” etc., or clear the screen.
- **Custom Dock:** Hover icons for tooltips, open Terminal or embedded blog/website windows.
- **Dark Design:** Inspired by Dragonfly, but adapted for a Mac desktop theme.
